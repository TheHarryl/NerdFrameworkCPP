# What is NerdFramework?
NerdFramework is a framework developed solely by myself, completely from the ground up. It covers anything I believe I would ever need, such as physics, rendering, interfaces, general 3D and 2D mathematics, natural language processing, and more.
### Complete list of features:

## Principles of NerdFramework
### Accessibility of Knowledge
My goal is to document the thought process behind any abstract concept present in the framework. Though you are welcome to use the NerdFramework as is, the NerdFramework is made also to double as a reference, from which anyone could easily understand all necessary concepts in order to create their own.
### Broadness
I plan to use this framework myself, for anything I would ever need to create. This means an exhaustive list of features, all of which would be thorough enough that any creation could ideally be reduced to few, elegant lines. From a larger perspective, this framework is made with the idea that any project that includes this framework would not need any other dependencies.
### Efficiency
This framework would be utterly useless to me if I did not attempt to make it as efficient as possible. Any programs I create that utilize this framework should run as smoothly as theoretically possible, or near close to it. Thus, all abstract implementations in this framework are engineered by myself to be as elegant as I can possibly make them.
### All Homemade
Another goal of the NerdFramework is to use as little internal dependencies or otherwise external code as possible. This means no copy-pasted StackOverflow and no helper dependencies. Any implemented abstract concepts would be a result of my own knowledge. This principle extends downwards to the lowest level, as even functions such as Math.Sqrt() and Math.Sin() that are usually taken for granted would be reimplemented explicitly. NerdFramework would also eventually no longer rely on MonoGame to create and draw to windows by its completion.
### Benchmark of Knowledge
At its most fundamental level, NerdFramework's main objective is to serve as a documentation or library of an accumulation of knowledge. Mine, more specifically. Spatial mathematics and rendering implementations in this framework are based on my interpretations of what I was taught in my Calculus 3 class. Physics implementations were, respectively, derived from the lectures of my Physics class. My goal is to implement everything I know that could possibly be utilized in a program into this framework. Consequently, this framework could eventually be synonymous to something of a benchmark of my own accumulated knowledge.
